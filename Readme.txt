Generative Design of a Vehicle Powertrain - Version 1.0

This MATLAB-based framework autonomously designs, tests and evaluates different possible vehicle powertrain architectures. It is limited to a specific set of component library, and can only generate sequential layouts (where components are arranged in form of a sequence/line).

Powertrain_Library_GenAI.slx is the Simulink library used by the framework. WLTP and NYC cycles are also provided with this code.
Check out the guide on parameters database text file if you want to edit the parameters file.

How to use:
1. Open the main.mlx live script and follow the instructions.
